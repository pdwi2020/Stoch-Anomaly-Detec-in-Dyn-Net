## üìú Abstract

Phishing attacks on Ethereum siphon hundreds of millions of dollars each year. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) appear ideal for detecting such abuse, yet their effectiveness is undercut by extreme class imbalance and noisy neighborhood signals. This paper proposes a two-stage hybrid framework that first learns value-weighted structural embeddings with a Graph Autoencoder and then feeds those embeddings‚Äîconcatenated with six parsimonious financial aggregates‚Äîinto an Isolation Forest. On the 3 million-node D3 Ethereum Phishing Transaction Network, the proposed model attains **AUROC 0.944** and **AUPRC 0.252**, delivering a **7.25√ó AUPRC** improvement over an unweighted hybrid baseline. Precision@100 reaches **0.33**, demonstrating practical utility for analysts. Results show that GNNs excel as *de-noising feature extractors* rather than end-to-end detectors when combined with domain-specific financial statistics.

## üîë Key Insights

1.  **GNNs as Feature Extractors:** The primary contribution is demonstrating that in noisy, value-skewed financial graphs, GNNs are most effective when used as sophisticated *de-noising feature extractors*, not as end-to-end classifiers.
2.  **Value-Weighted Attention is Critical:** Na√Øvely applying GNNs introduces noise and degrades performance. By making the GNN's attention mechanism dependent on transaction value, we suppress noise and achieve a **7.25x AUPRC improvement**.
3.  **Hybrid Models Excel:** The synergy between a GNN (for learning structural patterns) and a classical anomaly detector like Isolation Forest (for robust classification) significantly outperforms either approach in isolation.
4.  **Practical & Actionable:** The model achieves a Precision@100 of 0.33, a tenable workload for human analysts. The framework also includes a Value-at-Risk (VaR) calculation to translate anomaly scores into concrete financial risk.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Framework Overview

The proposed model is a two-stage hybrid framework:

1.  **Stage 1: Value-Weighted Graph Autoencoder**
    * A GAE with a GATv2 backbone learns 32-dimensional node embeddings.
    * **Crucially**, the attention mechanism is made dependent on the log-transformed transaction value, forcing the model to focus on financially significant edges and suppress noise.
    * The model is trained to reconstruct node features on a balanced subgraph of normal nodes.

2.  **Stage 2: Isolation Forest on Enriched Features**
    * The learned 32-dimensional embeddings are concatenated with 6 engineered financial features (e.g., `total_ether_sent`, `tx_count`).
    * This final 38-dimensional feature vector is fed into a 100-tree Isolation Forest, which calculates the final anomaly score for each node.
